This will involve creating a simple RESTful web service using Java, and then interacting with it through HTTP requests. Here's a brief outline:

    Create a Task Class:
        As mentioned before, create a Task class with attributes like title, description, due date, and status.

    TaskManager Class:
        Implement a TaskManager class that manages a collection of tasks.
        Include methods to add a new task, view all tasks, edit a task, and delete a task.

    RESTful Web Service:
        Use a framework like Spring Boot to create a simple RESTful web service.
        Create endpoints (API routes) for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. For example:
            POST /tasks: Add a new task.
            GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
            GET /tasks/{taskId}: Retrieve a specific task.
            PUT /tasks/{taskId}: Edit a specific task.
            DELETE /tasks/{taskId}: Delete a specific task.

    User Interface (Client Side):
        Develop a separate Java application (could be a console-based or a simple GUI application) that interacts with the RESTful web service using HTTP requests.
        Use libraries like Apache HttpClient or Java's HttpURLConnection to send HTTP requests and receive responses from the RESTful API.

    Input Validation:
        Implement input validation on the client side to ensure that users provide valid inputs before sending requests to the server.

    Dependency Management:
        If you are using a framework like Spring Boot, manage dependencies using tools like Maven or Gradle.

    Testing:
        Test the interaction between your client application and the RESTful API using tools like Postman or cURL.

    Documentation:
        Document the API endpoints and how to use them in your README or API documentation.

Deliverables:

    A well-organized Spring Boot project structure.
    Fully functional CRUD operations for managing tasks through a RESTful API.
    Unit tests ensuring the reliability of the application.
    Comprehensive documentation for developers to understand and use the API.

Note:
Feel free to leverage Spring Boot features such as Spring Data JPA for database interactions, Spring Boot Starter Web for building RESTful APIs, and Spring Boot Starter Test for testing. Additionally, consider using tools like Swagger for API documentation and Postman for testing API endpoints during development.
